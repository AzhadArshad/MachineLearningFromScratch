# MachineLearningFromScratch
A collection of machine learning projects and algorithms implemented from scratch as I learn and explore ML as a CS student. This repo includes various experiments, custom implementations, and tests on different datasetsâ€”focused on building intuition and deepening understanding of how ML really works under the hood.

This repository documents my journey as a Computer Science student learning machine learning by building algorithms from scratch, experimenting with different models, and testing them on varied datasets.

ðŸ’¡ What youâ€™ll find here:
	â€¢	ML algorithms implemented without libraries like Scikit-learn (e.g., custom linear regression, k-NN, decision trees, etc.)
	â€¢	Exploratory experiments with datasets (e.g., classification, regression, clustering)
	â€¢	Notes, mini-projects, and code that help me learn ML fundamentals

ðŸŽ¯ Goal:

To understand machine learning deeply by coding everything manually, making mistakes, and learning from them.
